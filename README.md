Body:

    I’m excited to share my latest project—an interactive analytics dashboard designed for the Marine Engineering sector.

    Using SQL for complex data extraction and Google Looker Studio for visualization, I've built a portal that tracks mechanical performance and offshore diagnostics.

    🔹 The Tech Stack: SQL, Google Looker Studio, GitHub Pages, HTML/CSS. 🔹 Features: Live interactive charts, raw SQL logic access, and downloadable datasets.
